Added a new helper utility to extract drivers' metadata for a Multitest environment. User can provide custom extractor function via new callable parameter `metadata_extractor` of :py:class:`Driver <testplan.testing.multitest.driver.base.Driver>` objects that can be called individually or for the entire environment on-demand through :py:meth:`extract_metadata <testplan.common.utils.helper.extract_metadata>`. A working example can be found in Best Practices examples.
