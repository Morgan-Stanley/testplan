Introduces a new category "Synthesized" for non-testcases report entries generated by Test runtime hooks (``after_start`` etc.) and Testsuite runtime hooks (``setup`` and ``teardown``). Those entries are no longer counted as testcases, and they will be marked as "sn" in Testplan web UI. For users having custom scripts traversing Testplan reports, **this could possibly be a breaking change**.
