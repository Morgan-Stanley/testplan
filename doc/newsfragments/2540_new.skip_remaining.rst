Added a new command line argument ``--skip-remaining``, a new argument ``skip_strategy`` to MultiTest, allowing remaining Testcases/Testsuites/MultiTests being skipped from execution when a Testcase has failed or raised exeception.

Argument ``uid`` of :py:meth:`Testplan.add_resource <testplan.base.Testplan.add_resource>` should now match the uid of the ``resource`` argument.
