Filtering Patterns now are easier to use with MultiTest with parts.

    * Support filtering MultiTest with both part-specified patterns and part-unspecified patterns.
    * Applying filtering patterns will not change testcase shuffling - the same testcase will always end up in the same part of a MultiTest.
