Introduced the filtering testcases in Testplan report feature (new command-line arguments ``--report-filter`` accepting a filter, ``--omit-passed`` equivalent to ``--report-filter=p`` and ``--omit-skipped`` equivalent to ``--report-filter=s``). This filter will be a string with each character representing one type of execution result of testcases to include in (using upper-case characters) or exclude from (using lower-case characters) the Testplan report.
