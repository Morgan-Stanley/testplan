Introduced the tracing tests feature (new command-line arguments ``--trace-tests`` & ``--trace-tests-output``). It takes a JSON files containing Python file names and line numbers, and traces the testcases that executes through these lines during Testplan execution, and report the result in test pattern format. This feature can be used for checking test coverage of Python code change. See :ref:`here <trace>` for more information.
